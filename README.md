# ðŸ’¬ E-Commerce Chatbot (Gen AI RAG project using LLama3.3 and GROQ)

An intelligent multi-intent chatbot built using **Groq LLM**, **ChromaDB**, **Streamlit**, and **SQLite**. It serves as a smart assistant for an e-commerce platform and can answer FAQs, perform product searches, and engage in casual conversation.

Currently, the chatbot supports three main intents:

- **faq**: Triggered when users ask questions related to the platform's policies or general information. eg. Is online payment available?
- **sql**: Activated when users request product listings or information based on real-time database queries. eg. Show me all nike shoes below Rs. 3000.
- **small_talk**: Engaged when users ask casual, conversational questions or initiate friendly exchanges with the chatbot. eg. How are you? or Tell me a joke.
