# ðŸ’¬ E-Commerce Chatbot (Gen AI RAG project using LLama3.3 and GROQ)

This project showcases a proof of concept (POC) for an intelligent chatbot designed for an e-commerce platform. It improves user interaction by accurately understanding queries and providing precise, real-time responses through direct access to the platform's database.

Currently, the chatbot supports three main intents:

- **faq**: Triggered when users ask questions related to the platform's policies or general information. eg. Is online payment available?
- **sql**: Activated when users request product listings or information based on real-time database queries. eg. Show me all nike shoes below Rs. 3000.
- **small_talk**: Activated when users request product listings or information based on real-time database queries. eg. Show me all nike shoes below Rs. 3000.
